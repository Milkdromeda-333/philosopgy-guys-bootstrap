# philosophy-guys-bootstrap
This is a work in progress to practice Bootstrap 5 by making a website teaching about philosophy.

Todo:
  add Favicon,
  make the modal more stylized and incorporate the input info

This project has helped me to practice learning new technology by myself, and problem solve, especially with using the dev tools, and be resourceful. I learned to make a (very simple) modal, and use the responsive grid system.
