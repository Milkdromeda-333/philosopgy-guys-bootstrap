						<h1>Pre-Socratic Philosophy</h1>
						<p>
							Pre-Socratic Philosophy Back to Top
							<a href="#">Western Philosophy</a> - by which we
							usually mean everything apart from the Eastern
							Philosophy of China, India, Japan, Persia, etc -
							really began in Ancient Greece in about the 6th
							Century B.C. Thales of Miletus is usually considered
							the first proper philosopher, although he was just
							as concerned with natural philosophy (what we now
							call science) as with philosophy as we know it.
						</p>

						<p>
							Thales and most of the other Pre-Socratic
							philosophers (i.e. those who lived before Socrates)
							limited themselves in the main to Metaphysics
							(inquiry into the nature of existence, being and the
							world). They were Materialists (they believed that
							all things are composed of material and nothing
							else) and were mainly concerned with trying to
							establish the single underlying substance the world
							is made up of (a kind of Monism), without resorting
							to supernatural or mythological explanations. For
							instance, Thales thought the whole universe was
							composed of different forms of water; Anaximenes
							concluded it was made of air; Heraclitus thought it
							was fire; and Anaximander some unexplainable
							substance usually translated as "the infinite" or
							"the boundless".
						</p>

						<p>
							Another issue the Pre-Socratics wrestled with was
							the so-called problem of change, how things appear
							to change from one form to another. At the extremes,
							Heraclitus believed in an on-going process of
							perpetual change, a constant interplay of opposites;
							Parmenides, on the other hand, using a complicated
							deductive argument, denied that there was any such
							thing as change at all, and argued that everything
							that exists is permanent, indestructible and
							unchanging. This might sound like an unlikely
							proposition, but Parmenides's challenge was
							well-argued and was important in encouraging other
							philosophers to come up with convincing
							counter-arguments. <a href="#">Zeno of Elea</a> was
							a student of Parmenides, and is best known for his
							famous paradoxes of motion (the best known of which
							is that of the Achilles and the Hare), which helped
							to lay the foundations for the study of Logic.
							However, Zeno's underlying intention was really to
							show, like Parmenides before him, that all belief in
							plurality and change is mistaken, and in particular
							that motion is nothing but an illusion.
						</p>

						<p>
							Although these ideas might seem to us rather
							simplistic and unconvincing today, we should bear in
							mind that, at this time, there was really no
							scientific knowledge whatsoever, and even the
							commonest of phenomena (e.g. lightning, water
							freezing to ice, etc) would have appeared
							miraculous. Their attempts were therefore important
							first steps in the development of philosophical
							thought. They also set the stage for two other
							important Pre-Socratic philosophers: Empedocles, who
							combined their ideas into the theory of the four
							classical elements (earth, air, fire and water),
							which became the standard dogma for much of the next
							two thousand years; and <a href="#">Democritus</a>,
							who developed the extremely influential idea of
							Atomism (that all of reality is actually composed of
							tiny, indivisible and indestructible building blocks
							known as atoms, which form different combinations
							and shapes within the surrounding void).
						</p>

						<p>
							Another early and very influential Greek philosopher
							was <a href="#">Pythagoras</a>, who led a rather
							bizarre religious sect and essentially believed that
							all of reality was governed by numbers, and that its
							essence could be encountered through the study of
							mathematics.
